# Bug Fixes Applied

## 1. Fixed Timestamp Format Issue ✅

**Problem**: Timestamps were stored as int8 (Unix milliseconds) which is not ideal for database queries and analysis.

**Solution**: 
- Updated database schema to use `TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIME ZONE` instead of `BIGINT`
- Modified keystroke tracker to send `Date` objects converted to ISO strings
- Updated TypeScript interfaces to reflect the change
- Created migration script for existing databases

**Files Changed**:
- `database/schema.sql` - Updated keystrokes table schema
- `database/migrate_timestamp.sql` - New migration script for existing databases
- `lib/keystrokeTracker.ts` - Updated to use Date objects
- `lib/supabase.ts` - Updated TypeScript interfaces
- `components/CodeEditor.tsx` - Updated keystroke recording to use Date objects

## 2. Fixed C++ Execution Output Issue ✅

**Problem**: C++ code execution was not properly parsing `cout` statements, especially `cout << "Hello, World!" << endl;`

**Solution**: 
- Improved regex pattern for parsing `cout` statements
- Better handling of multiple `<<` operators in single statements
- Proper parsing of string literals with `endl`
- Enhanced output formatting

**Code Fixed**:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello, World!" << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

**Expected Output**: `Hello, World!` (with newline)

## 3. Fixed Expression Evaluation Issue ✅

**Problem**: The code execution engine was not properly evaluating variables and expressions.

**Examples that were broken**:
- Python: `j = j + 1` and `print(j)` would output `j` instead of the variable value
- C++: `cout << i+1 << endl;` would output `i+1` instead of calculating the result

**Solution**: 
- Completely rewrote the Python execution engine with proper variable tracking
- Added support for Python for loops with `range()`
- Improved C++ variable declaration parsing
- Added proper expression evaluation for both languages
- Better arithmetic expression handling

**Test Cases Now Working**:

### Python:
```python
j = 0
for i in range(0, 10):
    j = j + 1
print(j)
```
**Output**: `10` ✅

### C++:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int i = 0;
    cout << i+1 << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
**Output**: `1` ✅

**Files Changed**:
- `lib/codeExecution.ts` - Complete rewrite with proper variable tracking and expression evaluation

## 4. Additional Improvements

- Fixed compilation errors in keystroke tracker
- Removed duplicate state declarations
- Updated documentation to reflect timestamp changes
- Added migration instructions for existing databases
- Created comprehensive test cases file

## Testing

The development server now runs without errors and all issues have been resolved:

1. ✅ Timestamps are now stored in proper DateTime format
2. ✅ C++ execution properly handles `cout` statements with `endl`
3. ✅ Python and C++ variable tracking and expression evaluation working correctly
4. ✅ For loops, arithmetic operations, and print statements all function properly
5. ✅ All TypeScript compilation errors fixed
6. ✅ Development server runs successfully

## Database Migration

If you have existing data, run the migration script:
```sql
-- Run this in your Supabase SQL Editor
-- File: database/migrate_timestamp.sql
```

This will convert existing Unix timestamp integers to proper DateTime format without data loss.

## Test Cases

Comprehensive test cases have been created in `TEST_CASES.md` to verify all functionality works correctly.
